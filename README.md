# Doctor Finder

Doctor Finder is a web app that helps you find doctors near you. You can search for doctors by what they do, where they are, and what insurance they take. Doctors can make their own profile to show patients what they offer. We made it to make finding a doctor less of a headache. Whether you need a checkup or you're a doctor looking for patients, Doctor Finder's got you covered.
